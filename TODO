    Still need fields:
        landcover
        mask
        projection information (cf compliant)
    Fix:
        rectbivariatespline uses missing values in interp. Need to mask out bad values after interp somehow... (use max and mins?)
            started this in icebridge... still need to test
        Conservative interpolation?
            RACMO
            bed?

    Remove CKTree as it's incredibly slow
    still need fields:
        lat
        lon
        landcover

        projection information (cf compliant)

scrip_grid.py
    make entirely independent

    combine
